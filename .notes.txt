EDA discoveries:

- White's rating is higher on average (by about 8) than black's
- Lowest rating in dataset is 784 and highest is 2723
- It will usually take black more turns to win than it will white: 57.8 avg vs 60.7 avg and draws go on for many more moves than wins
- White's rating and black's rating are not as correlated as i would have thought
- By far the most played time increment is 10+0 
- One player has 5 of their games in the dataset
- About 4 times as many games are rated than unrated
